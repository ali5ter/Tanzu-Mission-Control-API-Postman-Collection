# Tanzu Mission Control API Postman Collection
This is a [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/) for the Tanzu Mission Control API.

This collection is a number of tasks for operating VMware Tanzu Mission Control. The fleet management platform for Kubernetes offered by VMware.

The commands in this collection use the v1alpha1 APIs, which are currently the latest release. And should be used appropriately.
